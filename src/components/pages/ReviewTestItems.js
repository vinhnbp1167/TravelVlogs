      comment: 'As soon as I get off the plane from the U.S, this is the first place I landed in Vietnam. The weather is extremely hot here, so be careful with what you wear. You might pass out if you don’t have the appropriate clothes packed with you. One thing you might notice is that the air is really hard to breathe. That’s because Saigon doesn’t have a lot of trees to begin with, so you might have to get used to the air there. I don’t want this review to be so negative towards Saigon, but if you can get passed those conditions, then you are good to go to see the good sides of it'

      comment: 'Saigon can be overwhelming when you first step into it. It’s filled with motorcycles, traffic, and crowded people. This would have been so much easier if you have family members that live here. For those that don’t, you can never go wrong with district 1. District 1 is a place most tourists will stay since it is the fanciest area in the city. The crime rate is low, and everything is high quality over there'

      comment: 'You can find high quality restaurants everywhere in the city. But if you want to live like a local, you must try street foods. There are varieties for you to choose. My personal favorite is bánh tráng. It is a little spicy so be warned!'

      comment: 'I mentioned Saigon is filled with motorcycles earlier, that means it’s best to rent one too. Renting a car out might be too troublesome since you would have to go over the obstacles which are motorcycles. The traffic would be worse for you if you choose to rent a car out.'

      title: 'Uber vs Taxi',
      image: '/images/Lyft.jpg',
      comment: 'There might be some days you don’t want to rent a vehicle, so you are left with two options, uber or taxi. Taxis can be a scam since they might take you to the long route, and you would need to stack up a lot of money after that. Uber on the other hand, you would only need to pay the driver beforehand and they will take you to where you want to go immediately. This is the option I highly recommend due to the fact that they don’t drive you around in circles just to get money from you. An extra option is lyft. It is similar to uber but instead of picking up by a car, a motorcycle will pick you up'
